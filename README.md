## Description
- OOP class project.
- Just like the classic NES bomberman, we play as a character who has bombs as weapons.

## Assets
- Taken from various sources (I just google for them!)
- I draw the buttons, result scenes and floor.png myself.
- I make a formatted [file](./resources/map1.txt) for game map, you can create one for your own (Write a script for it is recommended).

## Sounds
- I google for sound effects.
- Background music is [STRLGHT - Clutch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1vcJPKHJ3A).

## How to compile and run
- You need [JDK8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) (Java SE Development Kit 8) to compile and run java classes.
- To play online via localhost:
    
   First run the game, the game will ask you if you want to run the server. Click yes to host one.</br>

   When another computer that also connects with localhost run the game, click "no" and both apps will automatically connected to each other.</br>
   Choose two players-online mode and enjoy the game.
        
   __Note: I haven't tried to run the third client (I dont have enough infrastructure to run and test that much clients üôÅ) so it might crash if you try to__
        
## How to play
- In single mode: _WASD_ key for movement, _SPACE_ to set a bomb. You lose if an enemy touch you or you are in an explosion.</br>
    Red ghost has random movement</br>
    Blue ghost is smarter, it follow you every where if it is possible to find at least a path.
- In two players mode:</br>
    Offline: _WASD_ and _SPACE_ keys for Luigi. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è and _P_ keys for Minotaur.</br>
    Online via localhost: Both are _WASD_ and _SPACE_ keys.
